Setting up Eclipse for ANT

First of all you need to setup an ANT property. 
Go to Eclipse Settings -> ANT -> runtime -> Properties -> Add Property and type in the name “BB_TABLET_SDK_HOME” and as value the path to your installed Playbook SDK. 
Insert another property with the name “FLEX_HOME” and point it to the same location … you’ll need this to use the mxmlc task.
